            <p style="  margin-left:10px;">Nyasa has always been for the students, by the students. Nyasa's goal has
                  always been to support and educate underprivileged children, see them grow as individuals, and help
                  them achieve their goals.
               </p>
               <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:80px">The aim of the Pathway program was to
                  admit children studying in Nyasa school to regular schools. The lack of affiliation of Nyasa with any
                  local government body was a major hurdle, and the migrating workers were unable to admit their
                  children to regular schools.</p>
